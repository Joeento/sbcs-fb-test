We are asked to ""integrate opportunities offered by emerging technologies with advances in what is known about how people learn."" Possible projects might involve intelligent test assessment to allow for adaptive teaching, tools for organizing learning materials, platforms for student participation or discussion, ways to solicit feedback from relevant communities in addition to just the course instructor, educational games, etc. To all you students and teachers out there, any thoughts? I'm looking just as much to identify problems as for potential solutions. What gets in the way of you learning certain things? What might help?
